# Intro

Can be used for example for **SPAM recognition**.
Text is classified into two categories (binary classification) - *SPAM* or *not SPAM*

There are several types of recognition:
 - ***rule-based recognition*** - we define many rules
 - machine-learning recognition
 - ***supervised machine-learning recognition*** - we gather many samples and let the program learn how to recognize SPAM

Another use-case is **Digit recognition**.
In digit from picture recognition we don't have just two categories but 11 - `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, -}`.

**Word-sense disambiguation**
We try to assign the correct sense of a word in a sentence. E.g.: word *line* can mean:
 - CORD
 - DIVISION
 - FORMATION
 - PHONE
 - PRODUCT
 - TEXT

And we ignored verb usage of word *line*.
