## Means of basic statistical analysis
There are several means we can use:
 - Frequency tables
   - display the frequency of categorical feature values
 - Contingency tables
   - display the frequency of values for combination of two categorical features
 - Mosaic plots
   - visualize contigency tables
 - Box plots
   - box-and-whiskers plots are good for statistical analysis of mean, median, variance, etc.
 - Scatter plots
   - display values of two numerical features

### Analyzing distribution of values:
 - histogram
 - quantile-quantile plot
 - distribution test
 
### Clustering
 - homogenicity
 - separation

Clustering similarity:
 - Cosine similarity
 - As a distance
   - Euclidian
   - Manhattan

Each cluster has its centroid.

Clustering algorithms:
 - Within-cluster variation
 - Total within-cluster variation
 - k-means
