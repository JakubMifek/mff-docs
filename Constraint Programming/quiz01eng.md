### What is a constraint?
Constraint represents a relation between several variables that narrows possible values of variables.

### How is a constraint represented?
Constraint can represented by a formula of problem's variables or in extension (a set of compatible value tuples).

### Formulate a Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists of:
  - a finite set of ***variables*** (attributes of solution)
  - ***domains*** (finite sets of possible values of variables)
  - a finite set of ***constraints***

### What is a solution to a constraint satisfaction problem?


### What is the difference between feasible and optimal solutions?
### What is constraint modeling?
### What does it mean that a constraint is non-directional?
### What does it mean that a constraint expresses partial information?
### What is a difference between Boolean CSP and Binary CSP?
### Can any CSP be represented as a Binary CSP? How?
### Can any CSP be represented as a Boolean CSP? How?
### What is a constraint network?
### What is a hidden variable?
