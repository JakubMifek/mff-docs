# Quiz #03: Look-back methods

### Why are the methods like backjumping called look-back?

### Characterize local search and backtracking using the same framework.
### What is thrashing?
### What are the problems of backtracking? How are they resolved?
### Which methods are used to detect the source of conflict in backjumping?
### Assume that a constraint network is a complete graph. Will there be any difference between backtracking and graph-directed backjumping for such a problem?
### What are the differences between graph-directed backjumping, Gaschnig backjumping, and conflict-driven backjumping?
### How do we identify the variable to jump to in graph-directed backjumping? And in Gaschnig backjumping? And in conflict-driven backjumping?
### What is themajor difference between chronological backtracking and dynamic backtracking?
### Why does backtracking do redundant work?
### Describe a method to remove redundant constraint checks that will surely fail.
### Describe a method to remove redundant constraint checks that will surely succeed.
