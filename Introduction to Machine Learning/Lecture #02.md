## Means of basic statistical analysis
There are several means we can use:
 - Frequency tables
   - display the frequency of categorical feature values
 - Contingency tables
   - display the frequency of values for combination of two categorical features
 - Mosaic plots
   - visualize contigency tables
 - Box plots
   - box-and-whiskers plots are good for statistical analysis of mean, median, variance, etc.
