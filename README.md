# MFF Documents
Documents I wrote or found during my studies at the faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University.

Most of documents contained in this repository will be written in Czech since Charles University is located in Prague, Czech Republic. But I'll aim for English content when possible and potentionaly useful.
