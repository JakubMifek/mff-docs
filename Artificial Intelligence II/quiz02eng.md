### Quiz #02 (Bayesian networks)
___
#### What is the relation between a Bayesian network and full joint probability distribution?

#### Define Bayesian network. What is a conditional probability table? Can there be undirected

#### cycles in a Bayesian network?

#### What is difference between causal network and Bayesian network?

#### Does the arc in a Bayesian network always describe causal direction?

#### Why does the CPT for one Boolean parent and a Boolean variable contains just two numbers (see the burglary example and CPT for MaryCalls).

#### In the burglary detection example, calculate the probability of burglary for all four possible cases of phone calls from Mary and John.

#### What is a Markov blanket? How is it used (in which inference method)?

#### Is there a single Bayesian network representing the given full joint probability distribution?

#### Describe a method to construct a Bayesian network.

#### How can a “good” Bayesian network be recognized (and constructed)?

#### What is inference in a Bayesian network?

#### Describe the enumeration method of inference. What is its major disadvantage (inefficiency)?

#### What is the relation between inference by enumeration and variable elimination methods?

#### How does variable ordering influence the variable elimination method (from the soundness and efficiency views)?

#### How do we get the factors from the Bayesian network? Demonstrate the basic operations with factors.

#### Sketch the core idea of the Monte Carlo method. What is a sample?

#### What is a direct sampling method? Why cannot it be used directly to do any inference?

#### What is rejection sampling? What is its major disadvantage?

#### What is the weight in likelihood weighting? How is the weight used? What is the major disadvantage of likelihood weighting?

#### What is the major difference between the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and rejection sampling and likelihood weighting?

#### Justify that MCMC works.
